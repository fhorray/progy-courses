# Scalar Types

Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

## Integers
- `i32`: Signed 32-bit integer (default)
- `u32`: Unsigned 32-bit integer

## Floating-Point
- `f64`: Double precision (default)
- `f32`: Single precision

## Boolean
- `bool`: `true` or `false`

## Character
- `char`: A Unicode scalar value, specified with single quotes `'a'`.

::note[Rust is statically typed, meaning it must know the types of all variables at compile time.]

## Your Task

Fix the code below by annotating the types for `price` (float) and `is_available` (boolean).
